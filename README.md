<b>About DrowsyDetect.AI</b>

<p>This project is a real-time driver drowsiness detection system designed to enhance road safety by identifying early signs of fatigue. Using computer vision techniques, it monitors facial landmarks, specifically detecting yawning based on the Mouth Aspect Ratio (MAR). If drowsiness is detected, the system generates alerts through an audio notification and a voice assistant. Additionally, it provides interactive features such as playing music, sharing weather updates, and delivering news headlines to help keep the driver engaged and awake.</p>

<b>Features:</b>

Real-time face and mouth detection:Uses OpenCV and Dlib to track facial landmarks and detect yawning.<br>

Drowsiness detection via MAR calculations:Determines yawning based on MAR values and triggers alerts if drowsiness is detected.<br>

Voice assistant alert:sProvides verbal notifications and wakefulness tips to keep the driver engaged.<br>

Audio notifications:Plays an alert sound to immediately notify the driver of detected drowsiness.<br>

YouTube music playback:Allows the driver to play music from YouTube to stay awake.<br>

Weather and news updates:Fetches real-time weather and news to keep the driver informed.<br>


<b>Face Landmark Detection Model</b>

<p>The shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat file is required for detecting 68 facial landmarks using dlib. This model helps identify key facial features such as eyes, nose, mouth, and jawline.</p>
